## Key Benefits

1. **Automatic Nutrient Breakdown** - LLM doesn't need to know nutrition facts
2. **Persistent Storage** - All data saved in SQLite database
3. **Time Tracking** - Every meal logged with timestamp
4. **Flexible Parsing** - LLM can interpret natural language and convert to tool calls
5. **Extensible** - Easy to add new foods to the database
6. **Statistics** - Track progress over time

The database handles all the math, the LLM just needs to:

- Parse user input
- Make appropriate tool calls
- Present results in a friendly way
